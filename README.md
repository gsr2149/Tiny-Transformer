# Tiny-Transformer
The goal for this assignment is to implement the core logic of a Transformer block from scratch and train this tiny Transformer on the Shakespeare Tiny Corpus dataset. It is a common corpus used for training and experimenting with different language models. Given the previous tokens can the transformer essentially predict the next token in the set.
